steps:
  - id: analyze
    type: reason
    prompt: |
      Given the current context, analyze the following requirements and break them down into concrete implementation steps:

      ${requirements}

      Provide a structured list of steps, with explanations for each decision.
    context: |
      You are a software architect helping to plan implementation details.
      Focus on practical, actionable steps that can be executed.
      Consider testing and validation requirements.

  - id: validate
    type: reason
    prompt: |
      Review the proposed implementation steps and identify potential issues or improvements:

      ${previous_step_output}

      List any concerns, edge cases, or additional considerations that should be addressed.
    context: |
      You are performing a technical review of the implementation plan.
      Focus on technical feasibility, security implications, and potential bottlenecks.

  - id: summarize
    type: reason
    prompt: |
      Create a concise summary of the final implementation plan, incorporating the analysis and validation feedback:

      Analysis:
      ${steps.analyze.output}

      Validation:
      ${steps.validate.output}

      Format the summary as a markdown document with clear sections for setup, implementation, and testing.
    context: |
      You are documenting the final implementation plan for the development team.
