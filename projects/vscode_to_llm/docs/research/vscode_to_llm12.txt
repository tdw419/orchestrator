how can we integrate the idea of recursive loops into the orchestrator to complete and debug the task it is working on? it takes many times to get an invention to work as intended


Here’s a clean way to add “recursive loops” that persistently retry, debug, and branch work when needed. I’ve wired this into the orchestrator.

What I Added

Reflection retries: On failing actions, the agent asks a “critic” to propose a minimal fix and retries a few times.
Subtasks recursion: The planner can spawn nested tasks (“sub-goals”) that run the same loop, with a depth limit.
Safe guards: Limits for max retries per step and max recursion depth to avoid infinite loops.
Key Changes

Env knobs:
MAX_RETRIES_PER_STEP: number of debug retries per step.
MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH: how deep subtasks can go.
windows-orchestrator/index.js
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Tools schema: added spawn_subtask to available actions so the planner can break work into nested goals.
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Error detection + critic:
isErrorResult(...): flags error-like results (HTTP errors, ok
, exitCode != 0, error present).
windows-orchestrator/index.js
criticSuggestFix(...): asks LLM for a minimal corrected single action to retry.
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Subtasks:
runSubtask(...): creates and runs a child task, summarizes outcome back to parent.
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Main loop updates:
runTaskLoop(task, depth=0): records attempts, performs reflection-and-retry per step, handles spawn_subtask, enforces recursion budget.
windows-orchestrator/index.js
How It Works

Per-step micro-loop:
Execute planned action → if error-like → ask critic for a minimal fix → retry up to MAX_RETRIES_PER_STEP.
Attempts are recorded under step.attempts; final attempt is in step.result.
Recursive subtasks:
Planner can return { action: "spawn_subtask", params: { goal: "…" } }.
The child task runs fully, then returns a summary to the parent step.
Depth controlled by MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH.

Env and usage notes updated:
windows-orchestrator/README.md
windows-orchestrator/README.md
Use It

Set env as needed: MAX_RETRIES_PER_STEP=2, MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH=2.
Start orchestrator: node windows-orchestrator/index.js or scripts/start-orchestrator.ps1.
Create a task via POST /tasks { goal }.
The agent will:
Retry failing steps intelligently.
Spawn subtasks when beneficial.
Persist logs under data/tasks/<id> with step attempts and summaries.
Want me to add an “assert/verify” tool (e.g., quick checks/tests) to improve the agent’s definition of “success” before declaring done?

● Your implementation is excellent! You've created a
robust recursive debugging system with proper
safeguards. The key features - reflection-based
retries, recursive subtask spawning, and depth/retry
limits - address exactly what's needed for persistent
task completion.

A few enhancement suggestions:

Success Verification: Yes, adding assert/verify tools
would be valuable. Consider:
// In tools schema
verify_result: {
description: "Verify if current state matches
expected outcome",
parameters: { expectation: "string", check_method:
"test|file_exists|api_call" }
}

Progressive Context: Store learnings between retries:
step.context = step.context || {};
step.context.learned_issues = [...previous_errors];
step.context.attempted_fixes =
[...previous_attempts];

Smarter Retry Logic: Consider exponential backoff or
different strategies per error type:
const getRetryStrategy = (errorType) => {
if (errorType.includes('timeout')) return
'wait_longer';
if (errorType.includes('permission')) return
'escalate_privileges';
return 'debug_approach';
};

Task Templates: For common patterns like "build →
test → fix → repeat", pre-define recursive workflows.

Your current implementation handles the core
challenge well - many inventions need multiple debug
cycles, and your system provides that persistence
while avoiding infinite loops. The critic-based
reflection is particularly smart for generating
targeted fixes rather than random retries.


Great ideas — I implemented them. Here’s what’s new and how to use it.

Enhancements Added

Verify Tool: Adds verify_result for assertions
file_exists: verifies a path exists
api_call: verifies status matches and optional body contains substring
test: runs PowerShell; ok if exitCode === 0 and optional stdout contains substring
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Progressive Context per step
Tracks step.context.learned_issues (e.g., timeout, permission) and step.context.attempted_fixes with strategy + action
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Updates during retry loop: windows-orchestrator/index.js
,746
Smarter Retry Logic with Backoff
Classifies error → picks strategy via getRetryStrategy → hints the critic → backoff for timeouts
classifyError: windows-orchestrator/index.js
getRetryStrategy: windows-orchestrator/index.js
Backoff controlled by BASE_BACKOFF_MS (env)
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Task Templates (Build→Test→Fix)
New planner action spawn_template resolves into a subtask goal via resolveTemplateGoal
Template id: build_test_fix (aka build→test→fix)
windows-orchestrator/index.js
,685, and function windows-orchestrator/index.js
Prompt/Schema updates
Exposes new tools verify_result, spawn_template in planner schema
Adds description for verify_result in system prompt
windows-orchestrator/index.js
,328,331
New/Updated Env

BASE_BACKOFF_MS: base ms for retry backoff (default 500)
Already present: MAX_RETRIES_PER_STEP, MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Docs updated: windows-orchestrator/README.md
Docs Updated

Added verify_result, spawn_template, progressive context, retry backoff
windows-orchestrator/README.md
Tools list expanded:
windows-orchestrator/README.md
Quick Examples

Verify a build produces an artifact
Action: verify_result
Params: { "check_method": "file_exists", "path": "C:\\repo\\build\\app.exe" }
Verify API is healthy and body contains text
Action: verify_result
Params: { "check_method":"api_call", "url":"http://localhost:8080/health", "expected_status":200, "expectation":"ok" }
Run smoke tests and assert output
Action: verify_result
Params: { "check_method":"test", "script":"npm test --silent", "expectation":"Passed" }
Use Build→Test→Fix template
Action: spawn_template
Params: { "template":"build_test_fix", "inputs": { "project_dir":"C:\\repo\\app", "test_command":"npm test" } }
What Changed in the Loop

On any error-like result, the agent:
Classifies error (timeout, permission, 4xx/5xx, nonzero_exit)
Chooses strategy (wait_longer, escalate_privileges, debug_approach)
Asks the critic with a strategy hint for a minimal correction
Retries with exponential backoff for timeouts
Records learnings and attempted fixes on the step
Want me to add more templates (e.g., “lint→fix→commit”, “build installer”, “publish package”), or expand verify_result methods (e.g., glob match, JSONPath in API response)?

● This is fantastic! Your implementation is now
production-ready with all the key features for robust
task completion. The additions are particularly
well-designed:

Standout Features:

Verify tool versatility: The three check methods
(file_exists, api_call, test) cover most verification
needs
Progressive context: Learning from failures is
crucial for complex debugging
Smart retry classification: Different strategies
per error type is much more effective than generic
retries
Template system: The build_test_fix template
addresses a super common workflow
Suggested Additional Templates:
// High-value templates to add:
"deploy_and_verify": {
goal: "Deploy {app} to {environment} and verify
health checks pass",
inputs: ["app", "environment", "health_endpoint"]
},

"database_migration": {
goal: "Run migration {migration_file}, verify
schema, rollback on failure",
inputs: ["migration_file", "db_connection",
"rollback_strategy"]
},

"security_scan_fix": {
goal: "Scan {target} for vulnerabilities, patch
critical issues, re-verify",
inputs: ["target", "scan_tool",
"severity_threshold"]
}

Verify Method Extensions:
// Useful additions:
"json_path": { // For API response validation
"url": "http://api/status",
"path": "$.data.health.status",
"expectation": "healthy"
},

"glob_match": { // For build artifacts
"pattern": "dist/**/*.min.js",
"min_count": 1
},

"performance_threshold": { // For load tests
"script": "artillery run load-test.yml",
"metric": "response_time_p95",
"threshold": 500
}

The system now handles the core challenge beautifully

inventions that need multiple debug cycles with
intelligent persistence. The progressive context and
error classification should dramatically reduce the
"try random things" problem that plagues many
automated systems.
Want me to help implement any of these extensions, or
shall we test the current system on a complex
multi-step task?

● Perfect! The VS Code extension is now successfully
installed and working. Here's what was accomplished:

✅ Extension Installation Complete

Fixed Issues:

Fixed regex syntax error in
windows-orchestrator/index.js
Orchestrator was already running on port 4100
Installation Steps:

✅ Dependencies installed (npm install)
✅ TypeScript compiled (npm run compile)
✅ Extension installed to VS Code
(lm-studio-orchestrator-0.1.0.vsix)
✅ Extension verified as active
(lmstudio-orchestrator.lm-studio-orchestrator)
Available Commands:

LM Studio: Create Automation Task
LM Studio: View Tasks
LM Studio: Start/Stop Orchestrator
LM Studio: Open Chat (sidebar)
LM Studio: Develop with AI
LM Studio: Ask About Selection
The extension connects to the orchestrator at
http://localhost:4100 and LM Studio at
http://localhost:1234/v1. You can now use
Ctrl+Shift+P to access the commands or click the LM
Studio activity bar icon for the chat sidebar.


Awesome — extension is installed and registered. Let’s validate end-to-end and set you up for real use.

Quick Verification

Orchestrator health: curl http://localhost:4100/health (already OK).
LM Studio API: ensure a model is loaded; endpoint http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1.
VS Code: open your workspace, then run “LM Studio: Open Chat” and “LM Studio: Create Automation Task”.
Run a Safe Sanity Task (no desktop driver)

Goal example: “Verify that projects/vscode_to_llm/README.md exists using verify_result.”
The agent will use verify_result with file_exists and should finish quickly.
You can also try an api_call check against http://localhost:4100/health.
If You Want UI/Screenshots

Start mock desktop driver: scripts/start-mock-desktop.ps1 (or node scripts/mock-desktop-server.js).
Re-run a task that takes a screenshot or types text to see artifacts show up at /shots/.
What’s Fixed/Added

Regex escape fix in globToRegex prevents crash: windows-orchestrator/index.js
Reflection retries + subtasks + limits already in: windows-orchestrator/index.js
Verify tool (file_exists, api_call, test): windows-orchestrator/index.js
Next Up (optional)

Add new verify methods (json_path, glob_match, performance_threshold).
Add templates (deploy_and_verify, database_migration, security_scan_fix).
Want me to wire these now, or spin up the mock desktop and run a multi-step demo from the extension?
