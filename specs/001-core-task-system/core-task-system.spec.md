# Feature Specification: Core Task Orchestration System

**Feature Branch**: `001-core-task-system`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Based on existing linux-orchestrator implementation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to submit a high-level task goal to the orchestrator and have it automatically broken down into executable steps, with progress tracking and error handling, so that I can automate complex workflows without managing the details manually.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a task request with goal "build GVPIE", **When** the task is submitted, **Then** it is assigned a unique ID and stored
2. **Given** a running task, **When** each step executes, **Then** logs and status are captured for inspection
3. **Given** a failed step, **When** retries are available, **Then** the system attempts recovery with backoff
4. **Given** a completed task, **When** inspecting the results, **Then** full execution history is available

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the OpenAI-compatible API is unreachable?
- How does system handle a step that exceeds timeout?
- What happens if desktop driver is unavailable?
- How are concurrent tasks isolated?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept task submissions with a goal description and optional parameters
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate an immutable task ID for tracking
- **FR-003**: System MUST store task metadata, steps, and logs under data/tasks/{id}/
- **FR-004**: System MUST break down high-level goals into atomic steps
- **FR-005**: System MUST support both desktop automation and shell command steps
- **FR-006**: System MUST capture stdout/stderr from step execution
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement configurable retry logic for failed steps
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide real-time task status via SSE
- **FR-009**: System MUST verify step results using pluggable verifiers
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce MAX_STEPS and MAX_RETRIES limits
- **FR-011**: System MUST support spawning subtasks with depth control
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide APIs to query task status and history

### Key Entities
- **Task**: Top-level unit of work with goal and metadata
  - ID, goal, creation time, status
  - Environment variables
  - Step history
  - Logs and messages

- **Step**: Atomic unit of execution
  - Action type (run_shell, verify_result, etc)
  - Parameters
  - Status and output
  - Retry count

- **Verifier**: Pluggable result validation
  - Method (file_exists, api_call, test)
  - Arguments
  - Success criteria
