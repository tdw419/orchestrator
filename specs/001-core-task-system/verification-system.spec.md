# Feature Specification: Task Verification System

**Feature Branch**: `001-core-task-system-verify`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Based on existing linux-orchestrator implementation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a task author, I want to specify success criteria for task steps that can be automatically verified, so that the orchestrator can determine if a step completed successfully and handle failures appropriately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a file_exists verifier, **When** target file exists, **Then** step succeeds
2. **Given** an api_call verifier, **When** response matches criteria, **Then** step succeeds
3. **Given** a test verifier, **When** script exits 0, **Then** step succeeds
4. **Given** a vscode_test verifier, **When** extension compiles, **Then** step succeeds

### Edge Cases
- How are timeouts handled in verifications?
- What happens when a verification script is malformed?
- How are permissions handled for file checks?
- What happens when API endpoints are unreachable?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Verification
- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple verification methods
- **FR-002**: System MUST capture verification details in task logs
- **FR-003**: System MUST enforce verification timeouts
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear failure reasons

#### File Verification
- **FR-005**: file_exists MUST check path existence
- **FR-006**: file_exists MUST support file size validation
- **FR-007**: file_exists MUST handle relative paths
- **FR-008**: file_exists MUST respect file permissions

#### API Verification
- **FR-009**: api_call MUST support HTTP methods
- **FR-010**: api_call MUST verify status codes
- **FR-011**: api_call MUST handle response matching
- **FR-012**: api_call MUST support timeout config

#### Script Verification
- **FR-013**: test MUST execute bash scripts
- **FR-014**: test MUST capture stdout/stderr
- **FR-015**: test MUST support expectations
- **FR-016**: test MUST handle non-zero exits

#### VSCode Verification
- **FR-017**: vscode_test MUST verify extension builds
- **FR-018**: vscode_test MUST support command testing
- **FR-019**: vscode_test MUST capture compile errors
- **FR-020**: vscode_test MUST verify extension loads

### Key Entities

- **Verifier**:
  - Method name
  - Arguments
  - Success criteria
  - Timeout settings

- **VerificationResult**:
  - Success status
  - Error details
  - Execution time
  - Output capture
